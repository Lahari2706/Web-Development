                   Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.

                    Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once,run anywhere (WORA) meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine(JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995.

                    R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.R is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical scoping semantics, inspired by Scheme.R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is developed by the R Development Core Team.R is an interpreted language.
